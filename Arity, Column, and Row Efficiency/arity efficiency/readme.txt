for each level of arity, we get some results like below:
arity level : 2 | |MPCOVER| : 14 | next |CANDIDATES| : 317 | cost : 291.597 seconds
arity level : 3 | |MPCOVER| : 13 | next |CANDIDATES| : 206 | cost : 663.705 seconds
arity level : 4 | |MPCOVER| : 13 | next |CANDIDATES| : 0 | cost : 429.887 seconds

Note: next |CANDIDATES| means number of CANDIDATES for next airty level.
And cost means runtime of current arity level.
