# Introduction
> This repository consists of source code and experimental results for our work on the Discovery of Cross Joins.

> All source code is located in <kbd>/Source code/crossjoin/</kbd>. You can set up some parameters in Constant.java and then just run it. Before you run experiments on a database (mysql by default), you need to change the database name and password to your own.

> The other directories keep all our experimental results, including experimental data, logs and some other materials.
