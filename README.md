# Introduction
> This repository consists of source code and experimental results for our work on Discovery of Cross Joins.

> All source code is located in <kbd>/Source code/crossjoin/</kbd>. You can set up some parameters in Constant.java and then just run it.
Before you run experimenst on databases (mysql in default), you need change database name and password into your own database and password, respectively.

> And the other directories keep our all experimental results, including experimental data, logs and some relative materials.
